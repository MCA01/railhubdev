  description: >
    This is a modern, responsive React landing page with clean design,
    built using functional components, TailwindCSS for styling, and
    React Router for navigation between sections.
  goals:
    - Keep components modular and reusable.
    - Maintain accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML).
    - Ensure mobile-first responsive design.
    - Avoid inline styles; prefer utility classes or CSS modules.

generation_rules:
  - Use TailwindCSS for layout and colors.
  - Create components under `src/components/`.
  - When generating text content, use neutral English placeholder text.
  - Always include prop types or interfaces.
  - Keep functions under 50 lines unless necessary.
  - Follow the order: imports → constants → component → export.

naming_conventions:
  components: PascalCase
  files: kebab-case
  hooks: useX format (e.g. useScroll)
  css_classes: tailwind utility first

review_guidelines:
  - Prefer semantic HTML elements.
  - Avoid redundant div wrappers.
  - Optimize for readability and reusability.
  - Write short comments only where logic isn’t obvious.
